explanation = 'Accordingly to ___ insufficient German language skills for children conducted during the school enrolment examination are not reliable or not conducted at all. This makes statements on the language level of all Berlin children and comparisons between areas with different proportions of children with migration background difficult. For this reasons a combined indicator "language deficits" got developed. \n\nFollowing groups are identified as children with language deficits:\n\n- children of German origin with conspicuous test results in the S-ENS subtest repeating sentences\n- children of non-German origin with a good knowledge of German and a conspicuous test result in the S-ENS subtest repeat sentences\n- children of non-German origin with insufficient knowledge of German\n\nAccordingly, children without language deficits are children of German origin with an unremarkable or borderline result in the Repeat sentences test and children of non-German origin with a good knowledge of German and an unremarkable or borderline result in the Repeat sentences test.\n\nThe combination of the different indicators are contain less missing data and thus enable a more complete representation of the developmental area of language in the school enrolment examinations, including children with a migration background.'
